Welcome to the UNOFFICIAL Colombian Cities Web Service. This is an open project that wants to give an easy handling to search and find a Colombian city or town using it's name or the department (state) name. You can also colaborate in this project that is just a way to give some tools to other developers to have other forms to find and get cities from Colombia faster.

To make your own services based on this one just fork and clone the repo using

```
git clone https://github.com/juanvidev1/colombianCities.git
```

Then just install the packages using
```
npm install
```

The project will run on port 5000 by default just for avoid conflicts if you're using react or some other front end development technologies that uses port 3000 by default. If you want to change the port you should create a .env file on the root of the project and create a PORT variable to change the port just like this
```
PORT=[number_of_desired_port]
```

That's all for now.

Thank you!
